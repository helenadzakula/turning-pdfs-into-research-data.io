# Introduction {.unnumbered}

**Do you ever feel that the data you need for your research is accessible but itâ€™s not in a convenient table, such as company reports or building plans? Perhaps the information you need is spread out across many different documents?**

If only we could read and extract structured data from thousands of written documents. 

Welcome to the course **Turning PDFs into Research Data**. In this course, we explore how to accomplish this task by combining web scraping, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Over four weeks, we provide online lessons and interactive sessions to learn the fundamentals of these key technologies.

## Topics

-   Methods for extracting text and files from websites using tools such as **Selenium** and how to avoid common pitfalls.
-   Methods for extracting text from images, such as scans of written documents.
-   Exploring technologies that can help automate data extraction from harvested text, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and a critical review of common data quality issues.

## Format

This is an online course.

-   **Week 1**: Watch pre-prepared video lectures about relevant theory and demonstration of example exercises. The topic is web scraping and OCR (\~45 min). Interactive Online Session (\~60 min).
-   **Week 2**: Applying last week's lessons to the example coding exercise or your own project (\~30 min). Interactive Online Session (\~60 min).
-   **Week 3**: Watch pre-prepared video lectures about relevant theory and demonstration of example exercises. The topic is NLP and common data extract issues (\~30 min). Interactive Online Session (\~60 min).
-   **Week 4**: Applying last week's lessons to the example coding exercise or your own project (\~30 min). Interactive Online Session (\~60 min).

## Weekly Meetings

The course includes 4 live Online Meetings, in which you will discuss the week's contents with the instructor and fellow participants:

-   Meeting 1: **March 13**, 2024, 4:30pm -- 5:30pm CEST
-   Meeting 2: **March 20**, 2024, 4:30pm -- 5:30pm CEST
-   Meeting 3: **April 03**, 2024, 4:30pm -- 5:30pm CEST
-   Meeting 4: **April 10**, 2024, 4:30pm -- 5:30pm CEST

## Prerequisites

-   Basic programming knowledge (R, python, ...)

    -   Note that the **course will be in Python, but if you only know R, this is still ok!** The code examples are simple and will run entirely on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), meaning you will not have to install anything. This course will make a good opportunity to try Python for the first time and you can also try the self-paced [BERD introduction to Python course](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/berd-academy/data-science-with-python/).

-   Willingness to learn new technical skills

-   A [Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en)

## About the Instructor

[John 'Jack' Collins](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/programs/cdss/our-students/2022/john-jack-collins/) is a PhD Student in Sociology at the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences. He holds a Bachelor's of Sociology with Honours from the Australian National University. Jack has a Master's degree in Data Science from James Cook University. His Master's project was regarding predictive modelling for student attrition from sub-tertiary courses in Australia. During his Master's studies, he also assisted in research projects regarding social attitudes and voting behaviour in Australia. Before starting PhD, Jack was a Senior IT Consultant specialising in data engineering, analytics and software development. Jack is interested in applying Data Science and IT to sociological research, particularly with regard to machine learning, analytics, and web applications.

## What to prepare

-   If you want to code in Python, you will need a Google account so you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You may also need to use your Google Account to open an account with [Llama AI](https://console.llama-api.com/). We will do this together during the course if necessary, so no need to prepare beforehand.
